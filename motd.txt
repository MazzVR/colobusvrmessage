Easter update is now gone, if you owned the cosmetics they will be in your locker.

Also re did the shop a tiny bit and moved things around, its also raining now. If you dont want the noise you can toggle it in spawn.

Also somethings going on in spawn it seems someones started digging and got them selves trapped with the rock bolders in the way...
